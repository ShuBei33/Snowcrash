# Snow Crash â€“ Levels 00 to 14

This repository contains solutions and technical notes for the **Snow Crash** project from 42 Paris.

The goal of this wargame is to escalate privileges from level00 to level14 by exploiting real-world vulnerabilities on a Linux system. Each level hides a password used to access the next one.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Gain hands-on experience in:
- Privilege escalation
- Binary exploitation
- File permission abuse
- Command injection
- Environment manipulation
- Race conditions
- Reverse engineering
- CGI & script vulnerabilities (Bash, Perl, PHP, Lua)

---

## âœ… Progress

This repository includes completed solutions for:
